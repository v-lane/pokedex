# Pokedex

In this Web Programming assignment, I used the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co), to design and develop a Pokedex web application that displays a gallery of Pokemon with images. Users can choose to load more Pokemon, view details about a specific Pokemon, mark Pokemon as "caught", and "release" Pokemon.
